##The Stocks Analysis 

###Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

This analysis takes a listing of 12 alternative energy stocks' daily volumes, turnovers, and returns from 2017 and 2018 corporate earnings datasets to analyze their performance based on their Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume, Return, Adj Return, △ Price, High-Low, Adjusted Rate, Volume to Close ratio, percent change between the two years.  The massive losses in volume of stocks on 2018 may be due to an economic downturn, or cirumstances in the green energy/solar manufacturing industries. No correlation can be drawn between the change in volume from 2017-2018 and the price or relative size of the ticker. The data may also serve as a predictor of a stock's survivability in the market if the stock was launched in 2017, as the first two years of an IPO launch for any stock, especially one in the relatively less dynamic commercial energy sector can be an indicator of the stock's performance.

The preliminary analyses focused on DQ, Daqo New Energy Corp based in Shanghai, which manufactures components for silicon and photovoltaic systems. It is a small-midcap stock with the second largest ytd starting price turnover, the standard adjustment parameters for closing daily value (the reasons for adjusted close for the Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure Plus and TERP are undefined).[^3] 

In reality, the relevance of studying this data can be limited. No isolated data set based on a set of physical earnings values is able to accurately predict stock market investments outside of trend permutations and can become a subjective exercise. Being contingent on a maximum range of transactional reactive factors including global situations, business negotiations, corporate situations, events, individual choices, trends, advertising, etc.[^1] Therefore, the while the market and its elements themselves are not predictable by any number of static analysis models (and otherwise reliance on fixed profit schemes have led to market downturns), they can be affected by various parameters of activities.

###Results: 
*Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script. 

2018 saw a marked downturn in stock volumes across the board compared to 2017 with only ENPH, RUN, SPWR, and VSLR managing to turn profits. 
A B/W field entry chart for T/F on the comparison of TDV, R, and HL values would show if there is a consistent relation between the various relative behaviors of the stocks in their resilience to a bear period.  

###Summary: 
*What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

Refactoring code is meant to make the code more efficient, process faster via most effecive loops and appropriate variable delcaration under subclasses of variables which have scaling byte storages.  Refactoring code also assists in circumventing a singular methodology to code problem solving.  Practicing discretion and awareness as to how code is presented for readability and ease of translation and communicability is relatively important a collaborative context. 

Disadvantages could include the fact that a code of technically "optimal" efficiency can omit various features that could connect to other options; the sake of what may appear to be "efficiency," especially applied in an absolutist, singular, or narrow sense be missed opportunities or avenues for more elegant solutions to the problem[13].  The optimal code would technically be the most formulaically coherent expression. 

'How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
	
It is possible to rearrange and streamline small aspects of this code, and test if specific smaller or larger ranges can relate inversely to each other in faster code.
